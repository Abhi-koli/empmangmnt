==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "Employees" - Properties:
    employeesID: String(50), Unique identifier for each employee
    firstName: String(50), First name of the employee
    lastName: String(50), Last name of the employee
    age: Integer, Age of the employee
    position: String(50), Position of the employee

Entity "Performance" - Properties:
    performanceID: String(50), Unique identifier for each performance record
    rating: Decimal, Performance rating of the employee
    comments: String, Comments on the employee's performance
    employee_employeesID: String(50), employeesID of associated Employees

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"Employees.csv":"employeesID;firstName;lastName;age;position","Performance.csv":"performanceID;rating;comments;employee_employeesID"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
